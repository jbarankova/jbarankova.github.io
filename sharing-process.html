                <h1>Sharing insured portal</h1>
                <p>Communication between the insurance agent and the client is very important. Ideally, the client should be able to keep track of changes in insurance as they work on it. Despite the fact that the product had a special portal for insureds, the non-obvious and hidden invite process significantly impaired the agent's work capabilities.
                    From the business perspective, it’s important to ensure an end-to-end insurance process. We changed the UX of data sharing and the number of invites increased by%.</p>

                <h3>1 — Research</h3>
                <ul class="section-list">
                    <li class="section-list section-caption">We started by understanding why users do not invite clients to the insured portal. To define it qualitative and quantitive research methods were used:</li>
                    <li class="section-item">— Interview with stakeholders and sales team</li>
                    <li class="section-item">— Heatmaps & user sessions recordings</li>
                    <li class="section-item">— Google analytics data</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="work-step-text">To easily navigate problem points, we made a schema of how the sharing process works now.</p>

                <ul class="section-list">
                    <li class="section-item section-caption">The following problems had been defined:</li>
                    <li class="section-item">1. Due to the complex invite process, 60% of agents did not even know about the existence of Insured Portal.</li>
                    <li class="section-item">2. The agent does not know what the insured will see on the portal.</li>
                    <li class="section-item">3. The old way gave the insured access to the entire portal with different insurances from different agents.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="work-step-text">To easily navigate between defined problems and possible solutions I made a simple matrix.</p>

                <h3>3 — Defining workflow</h3>
                <p class="work-step-text">I started with creating a workflow schema to consider all of the required data for the sharing and to keep in mind all of the extreme points of this flow. This schema helped us to close all of the extreme points of the workflow and helped back-end developers to quickly navigate the amount of data required for transfer to the front-end devs.</p>

                <h3>4 — Solution</h3>
                <p class="work-step-text">Keeping in mind that it was difficult for users to find the invite button and the fact that the agent needs to provide a link to data on a specific quote, we put the button "Share with insured" on the policy level.</p>

            <div class="work-step">
                <p class="work-step-text">We knew that agents didn't know what kind of the data insured will see on the portal. It was important for us to make the process of sharing information as transparent as possible so that agents can see what data they are transferring to the insured. We added description and a link to the preview mode of the shared quote on the insured portal.</p>
