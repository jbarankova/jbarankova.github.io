            <h1>Sharing insured portal</h1>
            <p>Communication between the insurance agent and the client is very important. Ideally, the client should be able to keep track of changes in insurance as they work on it. Despite the fact that the product had a special portal for insureds, the non-obvious and hidden invite process significantly impaired the agent's work capabilities.
            From the business perspective, it’s important to ensure an end-to-end insurance process. We changed the UX of data sharing and the number of invites increased by%.</p>

            <h3>1 — Problems</h3>
            <p class="work-step-text">1. Due to the complex invite process, 60% of agents did not even know about the existence of Insured Portal. We needed to describe what it is.<br>
                2. The agent does not know what the insured will see on the portal, because they have different interfaces, and the agent does not have access. We needed to give the agent the opportunity to see what agent is sharing with the insured.<br>
                3. The old way gave the insured access to the entire portal with different insurances from different agents. It is necessary to give the agent the opportunity to share only his work so that the client immediately gets to the right page.</p>

            <h3>2 — Defining workflow</h3>
            <p class="work-step-text">I started with creating a workflow schema to consider all of the required data for the sharing and to keep in mind all of the extreme points of this flow. This schema helped us to close all of the extreme points of the workflow and helped back-end developers to quickly navigate the amount of data required for transfer to the front-end devs.</p>
