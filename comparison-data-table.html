            <h1>Comparison data table</h1>
            <p>The cost of insurance and its coverage is the first thing the agent should agree with the client. There can be more than five offers and client only need to choose one.
                To make it convenient to compare insurances, we made a page with a table, which contains all the information necessary for a solution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="work-step">
            <h3>1 — Problems</h3>
            <p class="work-step-text">The agent fills out the necessary documents and receives offers on the price and coverage of insurance from the companies. Then he transfers the data to the client, the client compares them and decides which insurance to buy.
                Inside the product, the agent could not collect the information it needed to compare in one place. He manually transferred all the data to the table and sent it to the client outside the system. This is extra work that the product can do.
                We started with research. Determined what data the client needs to make a decision to buy insurance. We were assisted by business analysts and a sales team.</p>

            <h3>2 — Informational architecture</h3>
            <p class="work-step-text">We found out what data is needed. Then the technical difficulties began. It turned out that the necessary information is already in the system and we can use it, but it is presented differently. All because of the personal settings of companies and insurance lines. Therefore, we drew a diagram to understand how the data is split and where it is stored.
                This diagram helped us explain to the developers what we need and decide how to migrate the data. We realized that we needed a flexible table that would easily adapt to the data.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="work-step">
            <h3>3 — Design</h3>
            <p class="work-step-text">The most important information for the client is the price of insurance, it is at the very top. The following are detailed figures for each proposal. There can be many options, so we needed to make it possible to switch between policies and see all the calculations at the same time. So in case of horizontal scrolling, the sum of the policy and the names of the coverage are fixed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="work-step">
            <h3>4 — Outcomes</h3>
                <p class="work-step-text">For the first iteration, we took into the design only a part of the policy parameters. This allowed us to shorten the development time and get feedback from users faster. As a result we found out that the users we interviewed assessed the changes positively, however, most of the users of the product did not know how to get to this page.
                    Therefore, before the second iteration with improving the table, we decided to solve the problem with visiting this page.</p>
