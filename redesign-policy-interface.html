           <p class=" article-text date">Apr-Oct 2021</p>
               <p class="article-text">Policy interface was one of the business focuses in 2021. We had plans to integrate new features into this interface but before it, we needed to research user needs and redesign the policy interface to be more flexible to new changes.</p>

                   <h2 class="h2-article">Before</h2>
                   <p class="article-text">Policy interface had not changed for several years because the product was focused on the agents' works with quotes and submissions.
                       In 2021 plans had been changed, the business put the policy to the product roadmap and set several goals on adding big features to it.
                       But the interface had already been clunky and outdated, and did not respond to user needs.</p>
                   <p class="article-text">When users opened policy firstly they saw questionnaire and table. The main info was hidden on the last tab</p>

                   <p class="article-text">Even when thinking about business performance, it is important to keep the user-centered approach in mind.
                   Therefore, we studied the problems of users on this interface and updated it in accordance with users’ goals,
                   paving the way for the further addition of features and the growth of business metrics.

                       <p class="article-text">We started by researching the data of the interface's usage.
                       We checked the quantitative data to find out the attendance of the tabs and the popular actions on them. After that, we started collecting quality data:
                       </p>
                       <div class="article-text">
                          <div>— interviewed stakeholders and sales team</div>
                          <div>— conducted a competitive analysis</div>
                          <div>— reviewed support tickets</div>
                      </div>
                   <p class="article-text">Based on this data, we made an analog of CJM for features. It described what goals the users had and what information and actions are needed to achieve these goals.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="content-block-header">

                   <p class="article-text">
                       As a result, we found out that the old interface had redundant navigation. The main info was placed on the different tabs.
                       To put the info together user needed to move between tabs.

                   <h2 class="h2-article">Solution design</h2>
                   <p class="article-text">The main idea I followed was creating the main summary page for policy.
                   Users can get back to the policy after several months after working on it to check the info or upload endorsements docs.
                   All main info needed to be at a glance. Also, I needed to keep in mind that this page will be the starting point for adding new features.</p>

               <h2 class="h2-article">Prototype testing</h2>
               <p class="article-text">I built a Figma prototype and with help from the sales team tested it with 5 users to validate the solution.
                   We asked our users to complete 4 tasks and counted the number of completed tasks and time for each task.</p>
               <p class="article-text">As a result, we approved that one page with all main info helps users to easier find policy documents and main data.
                   Also we received useful comments to update the prototype.</p>

               <p class="article-text">For each iteration, we specified metrics to track how changes impacted users’ behavior and to change the plan
                   if something went unexpected. Except for the usual metrics such as bounce rate, time on page, we built a funnel to see how switching tabs had affected userflow.
